  "synopsis": "In the Forgotten Lands, a mountain wall breaks the waves of celestial energy that surge from the heart of the world. There grows Xiao, a little girl who plays with pebbles in a water stream near the small village where she lives, unaware that her fate will be filled with battles and death, and with continual affronts to the very limits of whatâ€™s possible. In a chaotic world where the survival of the strongest prevails, she is little more than a speck of dust in this vast universe.\n\nThieves, dragons, martial artists, secret sects, dark cults, stoic academies, immortal cultivators, legendary mages, and reincarnated figures who bear legendary abilities or artifacts with absurd advantages. And she, alone, with her small fists.\n\nCan Xiao, newly orphaned, carve a path among those who are destined for the martial pinnacle?\n",
